## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

Our area of interest in related to social economics and if certain attributes to a person affects how much money they make. We chose this topic after considering our own lives and wether what we value in terms of what we believe make us successful (ex. College degree) actually makes a difference in income earned. Our data also included some attributes that we were not considering that may also impact the income. Using this data will enable us to have a better understanding as to the what factors that are controllable (ex. Education) and those that we cannot control (ex. Race) to see how much of an impact they may have on someones success. This dataset also allows take different approaches to this multi-faceted problem due to the different data points surrounding a single person.
